- need to install redis on ubuntu machine (20.04 here)
- NOTE using async-redis instead of the original redis, it seems to default to the same port and settings, so
  I think all of this stuff is still valid
- on boot (if you get a port 6379 connection error)
sudo service redis-server start

- update stuff first
sudo apt update

- install redis
sudo apt install redis-server

- change "supervised no" to "supervised systemd" in config file
sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf

- restart service
sudo service redis-server restart

- see service options
sudo service redis-server

- check service status
sudo service redis-server status
- I believe it runs on port 6379 by default

- open cmd line
redis-cli
("exit" to leave)

- enter cli, set value in store, get value, exit cli, restart service, enter cli, get value again (persistence check)
redis-cli
set test "tester"
get test
exit
sudo service redis-server restart
redis-cli
get test

- ensure that redis is only accessible through localhost, in config
bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
- was already set by default
- check with netstat

- more info (should probably set up the authentication):
